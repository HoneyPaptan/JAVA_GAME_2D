# **My 2D Game** 🎮

Welcome to **My 2D Game**! This project was part of an incredible learning experience while following a course by **RyiSnow** on YouTube (*An awesome teacher, by the way! 😃*).

I learned a **ton** about Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and game development—all while using **only built-in Java libraries**. No external dependencies, just pure Java! 🚀

## 📚 **What I Learned**
This project was more than just building a game—it was an **invaluable learning experience**! Here are some key takeaways:

✅ **Java Programming** – Strengthened my Java skills with hands-on coding.

✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Applied OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure the game efficiently.

✅ **Game Development Fundamentals** – Understood the core concepts of 2D game design and development.

✅ **Game Loops & FPS Control** – Implemented a game loop to handle rendering and logic updates at a consistent frame rate.

✅ **Collision Detection** – Created logic for detecting interactions between the player, objects, and the environment.

✅ **Tile-Based Movement** – Designed a movement system based on grid-based levels.

✅ **Timer & Speedrunning Mechanics** – Learned how to integrate a countdown timer for an additional challenge.
